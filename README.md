# MTL-MinkUNeXt-VINE
This repository contains the code of the MTL-MinkUNeXt-VINE convolutional neural network. It is an extended version of the LiDAR place recognition [MinkUNeXt-VINE](https://github.com/JudithV/MinkUNeXt-VINE) model, with an additional branch with linear operations that performs a semantic place classification task using linear operations.
